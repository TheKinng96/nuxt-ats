## Why `.claude` directory?

1. **Organized Planning**: Keep all planning docs in one place
2. **Clean Root**: Main README stays focused on setup and overview
3. **Version Controlled**: Planning docs tracked alongside code
4. **AI-Friendly**: Claude Code can reference these files for context
5. **Team Alignment**: Everyone sees the same roadmap and todos

## Workflow

### For Developers
1. Check **TODO.md** for current tasks
2. Read **CLAUDE.md** for working structure
3. Reference **ARCHITECTURE.md** for technical decisions
4. Update **TODO.md** as you work

### For Product Planning
1. Update **ROADMAP.md** with new features
2. Break down roadmap items into **TODO.md** tasks
3. Document decisions in **ARCHITECTURE.md**

### For Claude Code
1. Start by reading **CLAUDE.md** for context
2. Check **TODO.md** for current priorities
3. Reference **ARCHITECTURE.md** for technical guidance
4. Update **TODO.md** when completing tasks

## Git Strategy

These files are **version controlled** by default. If you prefer to keep planning private, uncomment the `.claude/` line in `.gitignore`.
